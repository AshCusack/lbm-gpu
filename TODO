TODO:
- reorganize gpu files
- move computation loop to gpu 
- exclude memory allocation from MLUPS computation

URGENT:
- decrease the number of brances (for loops, ifs, etc)
- merge all kernels into just one kernel
- outsource resource allocation to initialize fields
- get rid of 2nd array

- check to see if there is a pattern is the numbers that are different, could be a bug, could be a float round off, its an open question
