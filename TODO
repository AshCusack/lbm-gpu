TODO:
- decrease the number of brances (for loops, ifs, etc)
- merge all kernels into just one kernel
- outsource resource allocation to initialize fields

- check to see if there is a pattern is the numbers that are different, could be a bug, could be a 
float round off, its an open question

MLUPS:
- Start -> 3
- One allocattion for all three steps -> 10
- Not takink allocation in count -> 12
- treatBoundary for GPU -> 20
- ComputeVelocityGpu without for loop -> 25
