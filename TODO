TODO:
- reorganize gpu files
- refactor helper functions
- move field initialization to gpu
- move computation loop to gpu 
- exclude memory allocation from MLUPS computation
- optimize cuda code


- decrease the number of brances (for loops, ifs, etc)
- merge all kernels into just one kernel
- outsource resource allocation to initialize fields
- get rid of 2nd array
